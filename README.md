Predict the white winner in a chess game on the basis of first move of white player and response of black player. In the dataset all the set of moves are given but I choose to predict the white winner the first move. 

# Data

# EDA 
In the github the analysis file contains the exploratory analysis and some visualization to understand the data visually.

Among all the models CatBoost model perform better with 78% of AUC score
